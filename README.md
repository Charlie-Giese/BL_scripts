# Scripts I wrote during my time as an intern at Breakthrough Listen

These are all the scripts I used during my time as an intern with Breakthrough Listen. 

Scripts in the folder rawudp_processing are for forming stokes vectors in .fil format from .rawudp files which are 
produced at I-LOFAR using the udppacketmanager; https://github.com/David-McKenna/udpPacketManager

Scripts in filterbank_processing were used mainly for plotting various aspects of filterbank files as well as the results of pulsar/frb searches using siproc.
Sigproc is most easily installed using psrsoft or from source.

Scripts are not super well documented right now, but most only need input constants and file locations to 'just work'

See also a detailed report of the work carried out during this internship, some changes are still in works but it's definitely 98% done.
