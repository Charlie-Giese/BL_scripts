# Scripts I wrote during my time as an intern at Breakthrough Listen

These are all the scripts I used during my time as an intern with Breakthrough Listen. 

'Summer' contains code from my early work and isn't hugely important in terms of SETI.

'Winter' contains all the scripts I produced while working on the SETI pipeline at LOFAR-SE and I-LOFAR.

Please see Instructions.pdf for a manual on how to run the SETI pipeline at both stations.
